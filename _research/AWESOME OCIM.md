Forward and inverse models are two widely used methods for studying the oceanâ€™s biogeochemical processes. Forward models use equations and physical parameters to simulate the ocean system's behavior over time, while inverse models estimate unknown parameters by comparing observations with model output. I applied the inverse modeling method to global ocean tracer models, developing models within the framework of **AWESOME OCIM** (John et al., 2020) and optimizing the model parameters with global datasets like GEOTRACES and World Ocean Atlas.
