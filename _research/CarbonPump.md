Ocean carbon pumps play a crucial role in regulating atmospheric CO₂ by transporting carbon from the surface to the deep ocean. I am particularly interested in the biological carbon pump (BCP) and carbonate pump, which drive the cycling of organic and inorganic carbon in marine ecosystems. The biological pump facilitates carbon sequestration through the production, sinking, and remineralization of particulate organic carbon (POC), shaping nutrient distributions and deep ocean carbon storage. The carbonate pump, on the other hand, involves the formation and dissolution of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) by marine organisms, influencing alkalinity and CO₂ exchange between the ocean and atmosphere. I use diverse numerical modeling tools to investigate the mechanisms controlling carbon transport and sequestration in the ocean, which are essential to ocean biogeochemistry and climate feedbacks. Understanding their sensitivity to environmental changes — such as ocean acidification and deoxygenation — is critical for predicting future carbon cycle dynamics.
