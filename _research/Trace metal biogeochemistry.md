Trace metals play crucial roles as micronutrients, influencing biological productivity and ecosystem dynamics, yet their distributions are controlled by a combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes. Biological uptake drives trace metal cycling, as phytoplankton assimilate essential metals like Fe, Zn, Cu, Ni, and Co in the surface ocean, which are subsequently regenerated through microbial decomposition and remineralization processes in the deep ocean. Organic complexation regulates the bioavailability of many trace metals, with strong ligand binding stabilizing dissolved species and extending their residence times. Scavenging onto sinking particles further removes trace metals from seawater, with rates influenced by particle composition and flux. Understanding and quantifying these processes is critical for predicting how marine ecosystems will respond to environmental changes. By integrating numerical modeling with observational datasets, I aim to unravel these interconnected mechanisms and their implications for ocean biogeochemistry, carbon cycling, and climate feedbacks.
