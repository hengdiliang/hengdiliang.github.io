(Project in progress)\
Done: Conducted machine learning to obtain global Ba distributions and the saturation states of barite\
Done: Generated the marine Ba distributions through a prognostic approach\
To-do: Diagnose Ba input/output fluxes in the ocean to interpret barite precipitation and dissolution locations
