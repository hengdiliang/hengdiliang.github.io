Forward and inverse models are two widely used methods for studying the oceanâ€™s biogeochemical processes. Forward models use equations and physical parameters to simulate the behavior of the ocean system over time. In contrast, inverse models are used to estimate unknown parameters in a system by comparing observations to model output, which can provide valuable insights into the complex interactions between ocean tracers and biogeochemical processes. During my PhD research, I applied the inverse modeling method to three global ocean tracer models ("ABC": alkalinity, barium, copper), using the water transport from the Ocean Circulation Inverse Mode (OCIM) (DeVries, 2014; DeVries & Primeau, 2011), and developing the models within the framework of AWESOME OCIM (John et al., 2020). The procedures of the inverse models are shown in the figure below.
