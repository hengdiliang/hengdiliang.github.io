I am Hengdi Liang (梁恒頔), a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Global Ecology at Carnegie Science. I’m based at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) campus in Pasadena, California.

I am interested in the ocean biogeochemical cycles and Earth system models, with a particular focus on the interactions between microorganisms and the marine environment. I develop numerical models to simulate microbial processes that shape nutrient and organic matter cycling in the global oceans, integrating observational data to test and refine mechanistic hypotheses.
