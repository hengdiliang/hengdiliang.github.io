### The upper-mantle structure beneath Alaska imaged by teleseismic S-wave reverberations


### Thermoelasticity of phase D and implications for low-velocity anomalies and local discontinuities at the uppermost lower mantle

### Elasticity of akimotoite under the mantle conditions: Implications for multiple discontinuities and seismic anisotropies at the depth of ∼600–750 km in subduction zones
